## A Reactjs, Nextjs based, Meetup application
---
This is a simple Reactjs, Nextjs based, Meetup application to challenge with Nextjs tricks.
This application is also deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and works with [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites... [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js)


It should be noted that this app is developed during the Nextjs course with dear [Maximilian Schwarzmueller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller) :heart:.
Also, **.env** file is ignored for security reasons :innocent:

**The online version of this project is avalable [HERE](www.vercel.com).**
